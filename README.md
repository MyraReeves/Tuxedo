# HelloWorldDemo

This is a demo first GitHub website created for CodeFellows Course 102

Below are copied instructions that were inside the lab assignments on Canvas.  The words were written by [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) curriculum staff for March 2023.

## 1️⃣ Lab Instructions for HTML-Only Website from Scratch:
We now know that Markdown + GitHub Pages is powerful for creating quick sites! To embrace the next level of challenge, it’s time we go back to crafting our web pages from scratch, by hand, line by line.

Setup and Documentation
* Review the web site creation process from your reading assignment.

Requirements
* Partner up. Decide on a topic for the web site you want to build. Each person will be responsible for 1 page of the site.

* Together, draw a single wireframe on a whiteboard, that can be used for all the pages of your site.
  * Keep it at low-fidelity.
  * Identify the general content areas.
  * Think carefully! This is what you are going to code up in markup.
* Apply html to the structure
  * Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.
  * Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.
* Choose your verbiage.
  * Write out the key content to fill in each page’s content areas of the wireframe.
  * You don’t need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.
* Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan.
* Write the code!
  * Each partner creates their own repository to work from. How do we get a new repository on our local computer?
  * Each partner codes their own `index.html file`, matching the wireframe.
  * From this point forward, all your work should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember… A-C-P)
  * Each partner should end up with their own `index.html` file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different content within the tags.
  * Link up the pages so a user can navigate to both pages.

Submission Instructions
* Submit your live url after deploying your site with GitHub pages. Check out what other people built, as well.

## 2️⃣ Lab Instructions for Hand-Rolled CSS

Team up with your partner and add some styles to the structure you built from the wireframe.

Setup and Documentation
* Start by going back to the whiteboard. Recreate your wireframe, and work with your partner to identify what styles you can apply.
* Utilize coordinated colors from a color-scheme web site like Adobe’s. Label your wireframe with what colors go where.
* Now is a good time to develop your Google-fu. As you identify specific things you’d like to accomplish in your design, see if you can craft a google search that brings you the answer. Implement what you find, to practice writing CSS.

Submission Instructions
* Share your site url once again, so people can compare the before and the after. As you check out the work others did, try guessing at which tags are where!
