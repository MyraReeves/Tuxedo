# Tux - A Boston Terrier's Website

<br>

This is a demo website created as a five-part group project for CodeFellows Beginner Course 102.  It was created in collaboration with [Dan Quinn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-quinn-70798726b/) to create a mock website showcasing his adorable dog named Tuxedo ("Tux"). I created the page that is linked to here and Dan created the other page on it. The assignment instructions below were written by [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) curriculum staff.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1 - HTML-Only Website from Scratch:

Requirements
* Partner up. Decide on a topic for the web site you want to build. Each person will be responsible for 1 page of the site.

* Together, draw a single wireframe on a whiteboard, that can be used for all the pages of your site.
  * Keep it at low-fidelity.
  * Identify the general content areas.
  * Think carefully! This is what you are going to code up in markup.
* Apply html to the structure
  * Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.
  * Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.
* Choose your verbiage.
  * Write out the key content to fill in each page‚Äôs content areas of the wireframe.
  * You don‚Äôt need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.
* Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan.
* Write the code!
  * Each partner creates their own repository to work from. How do we get a new repository on our local computer?
  * Each partner codes their own `index.html file`, matching the wireframe.
  * From this point forward, all your work should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills!
  * Each partner should end up with their own `index.html` file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different content within the tags.
  * Link up the pages so a user can navigate to both pages.

<br>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2 - Hand-Rolled CSS:

Team up with your partner and add some styles to the structure you built from the wireframe.

Setup and Documentation
* Start by going back to the whiteboard. Recreate your wireframe and work with your partner to identify what styles you can apply.
* Utilize coordinated colors from a color-scheme web site like Adobe‚Äôs. Label your wireframe with what colors go where.
* Now is a good time to develop your Google-fu. As you identify specific things you‚Äôd like to accomplish in your design, see if you can craft a google search that brings you the answer. Implement what you find, to practice writing CSS.

<br>

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3 - Dynamic Page Additions with JavaScript:

Review your page‚Äôs wireframe. Look at the content, and select a few places where you could add in something dynamic.

Requirements
* Add at least 3 dynamic components to your web page.
  * At least one dynamic component should be based on user input.
  * At least one dynamic component should use a conditional statement to determine the output.

<br>

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4 - Refactoring with JS Functions:

Requirements
* Use functions to improve the clarity and readability of your code.
* Wrap related steps into a single function. Be sure you are properly defining the function, calling it, and getting the return value you expect.
* Add a check to the user input you are getting, to see if the initial user input is an acceptable value. If not, present the user with an error message and a second chance to enter a proper value.

<br>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Step 5 - Loop the Loop:

Work from your existing code base. If it‚Äôs not a git repo yet, take a minute to set it up to sync to your account on GitHub.

Requirements
* Add validation on one of the user inputs.
  * Keep asking until an acceptable value is entered.
* Show an image related to your page‚Äôs topic, repeated within your page.
  * Prompt the user with a relevant question for a number (e.g.: ‚ÄúHow many cats do you want?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat star rating would you give, 1-5?‚Äù)
  * Use a loop in your JavaScript code to show the image that many times.
* Use functions to make your code more readable
